Juneau is a bot for <a href="http://discord.gg">Discord</a>, written in Java using the <a href="https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J">Discord4J</a> API. The bot was created to be used in the DACC Programming
Discord guild for general purposes and to be able to easily help anyone that may need assistance.
<br><br>
Juneau allows a way for users to send commands to the chat, and receive something back. this could be something simple such as listing class information, to something more complex like storing a sentence or image to a
 database, that can be retrived later on by its specific ID.

The DACC Programming Discord is a place where students that are currently enrolled in any Computer Programming courses can come in and ask for help/advice on anything they would like. The main goal of this Discord
is to help other students that may be falling behind or struggling with concepts, or just in the class in general. The #1 rule is no spoon-feeding, because we want these students to learn how to accomplish their task and
not just give them the answer.
